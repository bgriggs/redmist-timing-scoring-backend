# ?? Quick Fix: Enable GitHub Actions Deployment

## The Problem
```
? Branch "main" is not allowed to deploy to github-pages
```

**Why?** Pages is set to deploy from `gh-pages` branch, but workflow uses GitHub Actions deployment.

## The Solution

### One Simple Change in GitHub Settings:

1. **Go to Repository Settings**
   ```
   https://github.com/bgriggs/redmist-timing-scoring-backend/settings/pages
   ```

2. **Change This Setting:**
   
   **From:**
   ```
   Source: Deploy from a branch
   Branch: gh-pages
   ```
   
   **To:**
   ```
   Source: GitHub Actions  ? Click this!
   ```

3. **That's It!** ?
   - Setting saves automatically
   - No code changes needed
   - Workflow will work immediately

## Visual Guide

```
GitHub.com ? Your Repo ? Settings ? Pages

Build and deployment
??? Source: [Dropdown ?]
?   ??? Deploy from a branch     ? Currently selected
?   ??? GitHub Actions            ? SELECT THIS! ?
```

## After Changing

1. **Push your changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .github/workflows/docs.yml
   git commit -m "Ready for GitHub Actions deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Watch it work:**
   - Actions tab ? "Deploy Documentation" ? ? Success
   - Settings ? Pages ? "Your site is live at..."
   - Visit: https://bgriggs.github.io/redmist-timing-scoring-backend/

## Result

? Documentation builds automatically on every push  
? Deploys directly via GitHub Actions  
? No `gh-pages` branch needed  
? Faster, modern deployment
